# Python-OOP

A comprehensive collection of Object-Oriented Programming examples implemented in Python.

## 🌟 Repository Overview

This repository contains practical demonstrations of core Object-Oriented Programming concepts using Python. Each example is designed to illustrate specific OOP principles including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## 📚 Examples

### 1. Apple Smartphone Class Hierarchy

A detailed class structure modeling Apple's iPhone with appropriate attributes and methods.

**Key concepts demonstrated:**
- Encapsulation of data and behavior
- Multi-level inheritance (ElectronicDevice → AppleDevice → AppleSmartphone)
- Constructor chaining using `super()`
- Method overriding for specialized behavior
- Class-specific functionality

**Features:**
- Core phone capabilities (calls, texts, photos)
- Device management (power, apps, connectivity)
- Information systems (battery, storage, specifications)

### 2. Vehicle Polymorphism Challenge

A demonstration of polymorphism through different vehicle types that share a common interface but implement movement differently.

**Key concepts demonstrated:**
- Inheritance from a base Vehicle class
- Polymorphic behavior through method overriding
- Dynamic dispatch based on object type
- Collection of different objects sharing an interface

**Vehicle Types:**
- 🚗 Car - Drives on land
- 🚢 Boat - Sails on water
- ✈️ Plane - Flies through air
- 🌊 Submarine - Submerges underwater

## 🚀 How to Run

Each example can be run independently:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AmungaBrenda/python-OOP.git
cd python-OOP

# Run the Apple Smartphone example
python3 apple_smartphone.py

# Run the Vehicle Polymorphism example
python3 vehicle_polymorphism.py
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of core OOP principles:

1. **Classes and Objects**: Creating blueprints and instances
2. **Inheritance**: Building hierarchies of related classes
3. **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different implementations
4. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data
5. **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details, showing only essentials
